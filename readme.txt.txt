My Design and Coding Resources
One thing that students love the most about my courses is my design and coding resources page.

It contains resources spread across 10 categories, and one of them is JavaScript. Some of the webpages that I show you during the course can be found right at the resources page.

So here is the link:

http://codingheroes.io/resources/

The resource page also gets regular updates. I'm always looking for new resources all over the internet, and so as soon as I find a couple new ones, I update the page to make it even better for you.

Datatypes:

Number - *all* floating points, even if we don't see them.
String - sequence of characters used for text
Boolean - logical data type - true or false
Undefined - data type assigned to a variable which does not have a value yet - nonexistent
Null - also means nonexistent but slightly more specific.

JS has dynamic typing - do not have to manually define datatype of a variable. JS figures it out on its own and on the fly.
